# Definitions

Machine learning refers to a set of algorithms which make a machine \(with a computer as its brain\) to apparently learn. While learning in animals and human is not very well understood, in machines it is simply to find a generic rule, given a set of examples, which

Machine learning refers to a set of methodologies that make machines apparently "learning" to perform tasks. Although it is hard to define learning, it is related to progressive improvement in performing a task successfully. Intuitively there are two types of learning: self-learning \(unsupervised\) and learning from others \(supervised\).
