# Why the hype?

See [this blog](http://ai-a2z.blogspot.com/2019/07/what-is-data-science.html) for more information on this topic.

Data science is the science of dealing with data to extract patterns, which, eventually, are used to present information about how future look like given the history. You have all seen the following picture as a mean of defining what is this data science:

While the picture is quite telling, it has a lot of details to be clarified. Obviously, a data scientist requires Computer Science, Mathematics, and Domain knowledge. But each of these is, on their own, a large field of study. I personally believe that the more you know in these areas the better you will be in solving data science-related problems. However, "what do we need from each of these to get started" is a fair question.

Mathematics provide methodologies required to design solutions for problems. Methodologies like classification, clustering, statistical tests, and even neural networks have deep mathematical bases which enable their effectiveness in solving relevant problems. Computer science, however, provides techniques to implement these methodologies, ranging from programming languages, algorithmic design, complexity theory, software design and architecture, databases, cloud, among others. Clearly. skills from computer science and Mathematics provide tools to solve a problem, essentially what can we solve \(How to solve a problem\). However, they do not provide any information about what would worth solving, essentially what needs to be solved \(What to solve and why to solve it\). This information is provided by the domain knowledge \(or subject matter experts, SMEs\).

 Pure Mathematics is always well ahead of other sciences simply because it does not require much of infrastructure \(labs, equipment, etc.\). When it becomes apply, however, the issue of infrastructure comes into place. Most techniques used in data science are quite old. For example, the "State-of-the-art" convolutional neural network is nearly 25 years old \(see [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yann_Lecun/publication/2453996_Convolutional_Networks_for_Images_Speech_and_Time-Series/links/0deec519dfa2325502000000.pdf)\). Of course new advances have happened ever since, still, most used methods in data science are linear regression, support vector machines, among others. So, the question is, why data science has become so popular only recently if the knowledge already existed. Here are some reasons.  


* **Maturity of methods**: With the internet, the methods invented by mathematicians are shared more rapidly and publicized better, which makes them more accessible for whoever interested. In the meantime, many people simplify the methodologies for better understanding. 
* **Cheap data collection**: Sensors and electronic devices have become much more affordable than before. The cost of sensors is drastically reducing, in 2004 the average cost of sensors was $1.30 and in the year 2020, it is expected to come down to $0.38 \(see [this](https://www.ennomotive.com/industrial-iot-sensor-prices/)\).

* **Cheap data storage**: The prices of storage hard drives per GB per year has dropped significantly. This enables easier data storage, hence, more data can be collected.

* **Accessibility of data**: Internet is one of the most important factors that has increased accessibility to information significantly. This is required for a data scientist.
* **Much more compute power**: Convolutional neural networks were not publicized until 2012 when they were finally implemented on effective hardware, a massively parallelizable idea on GPU. Mainframes have been replaced by very accessible clusters and clouds. Processing power per CPU core has significantly increased \(see [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)\). Apollo Guidance Computer which guided the space-craft to the moon had a CPU with 2 MhZ of clock and 4KB of RAM! Way way less power compared to our phones today.

And we are still far behind the processing, memory, and storage power of the human brain:
