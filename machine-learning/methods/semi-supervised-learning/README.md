# Semi-supervised learning

  
We always need labeled data for supervised learning. But we usually have lots of unlabeled data too. Semi-supervised learning uses the labeled data for learning, and unlabeled data to improve how “sure” it is on the boundaries it has learnt. Potential use case: An example was the diamond Hackathon had a huge set of unlabeled data we could use.
